        "In this data preparation process for sentiment analysis using the IMDB dataset, we begin by setting two key hyperparameters: max_features to 10,000, limiting our vocabulary to the 10,000 most frequent words, and max_len to 200, ensuring each review is truncated or padded to 200 words for uniformity. We then load the IMDB dataset, which contains movie reviews encoded as sequences of integers representing word indices. By specifying num_words=max_features, we retain only the top 10,000 most frequent words, with less frequent words replaced by an out-of-vocabulary token. Following this, we standardize the length of each review using Keras's pad_sequences function, which pads shorter sequences with zeros and truncates longer ones to ensure all inputs are of length 200. This uniformity is crucial for feeding data into neural network models, as it ensures consistent input dimensions and facilitates efficient processing."

        "​In this data preparation and modeling workflow for sentiment analysis using the IMDB dataset, we begin by defining two key hyperparameters: max_features is set to 10,000, restricting our vocabulary to the 10,000 most frequent words, and max_len is set to 200, ensuring each review is truncated or padded to 200 words for uniformity. We then load the IMDB dataset, which contains movie reviews encoded as sequences of integers representing word indices, retaining only the top 10,000 most frequent words. To standardize input lengths, we utilize Keras's pad_sequences function to pad shorter sequences with zeros and truncate longer ones, resulting in all reviews having a uniform length of 200 words. This uniformity is crucial for feeding data into neural network models, as it ensures consistent input dimensions and facilitates efficient processing. Subsequently, we construct a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model using Keras's Sequential API, comprising three primary layers: an Embedding layer that converts input integers into dense 128-dimensional vectors, allowing the model to work with continuous input representations; a GRU layer with 128 units, designed to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data, with dropout and recurrent dropout rates set to 0.2 to prevent overfitting; and a Dense output layer with a sigmoid activation function that outputs a single value between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary classification tasks. By stacking these layers, the model can process sequences of word indices, capture their temporal relationships, and produce predictions, such as determining the sentiment of a movie review."

        "​In this phase of the sentiment analysis project, we focus on compiling and training the GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) model using the IMDB dataset. We begin by compiling the model with the binary cross-entropy loss function, suitable for binary classification tasks, and the Adam optimizer, known for its efficiency in training deep learning models. Additionally, we specify 'accuracy' as the evaluation metric to monitor the model's performance during training. Training is conducted over five epochs with a batch size of 32, meaning the entire dataset is passed through the model five times, and updates to model weights occur after processing each batch of 32 samples. This approach aims to optimize the model's ability to accurately predict the sentiment of movie reviews."
